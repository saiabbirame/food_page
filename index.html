		<h2>The Essence of Tamil Eeelam Flavours</h2>
		<p>Tamil Eelam cooking combines spice, texture, and aroma. Coconut milk adds richness, while chili and tamarind bring heat and tang. Every meal balances these flavours beautifully.</p>

		<h3>Key Ingredients:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Coconut milk</li>				
			<li>Curry leaves</li>
			<li>Tamarind</li>
			<li>Mustard seeds</li>
			<li>Dried red chilies</li>
			<li>Fennel Seeds</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Cooking Techniques</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Tempering spices in hot oil ("Thaalippu")</li>
				<ul>
					<li>This means heating oil and adding mustard seeds, curry leaves, and sometimes dried chilies or onions to release their aroma before adding other ingredients.</li>
					<li>It's the base of many Tamil curries and lentil dishes.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Grinding fresh masala pastes</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Instead of using store-bought powders, cooks grind spices, onions, garlic, and coconut together to make a thick, flavorful paste.</li>
					<li>This gives Tamil curries their rich, homemade taste.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Slow simmering for deep flavor</li>
				<ul>
					<li>After adding the paste and liquids, dishes are simmered on low heat for a long time.</li>
					<li>This allows all the spices and ingredients to blend together and taste stronger.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Serving on banana leaves for tradition</li>
				<ul>
					<li>In Tamil culture, food is often served on banana leaves - it's eco-friendly, aromatic, and believed to enhance the flavor of the meal.</li>
					<li>It's also a sign of respect when serving guests.</li>
				</ul>
		</ol>
